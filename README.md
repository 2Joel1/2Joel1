# Hey there 👋

I'm Joel, currently doing an apprenticeship as an Application Developer in Germany.

I enjoy building small software solutions for myself and my friends, turning ideas into practical tools.

My main focus right now is C# and .NET development, but I also have basic experience with C++ and PHP.  
Over time, you'll find more and more of my projects in my public repositories as I continue to grow and improve.
